# Description

This folder contains common data structures and algorithms. Currently, we have an interval map data structure and a bisection algorithm for sorted arrays. More structures and algorithms can be added here. The code is written in TypeScript. To compile `IntervalMap.ts`, for example, type

```bash
npx tsc src/algorithms/IntervalMap.ts --strict
```
