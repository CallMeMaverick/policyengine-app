# Data structures and algorithms

This folder contains common data structures and algorithms. Currently, we have an interval map data structure and a bisection algorithm for sorted arrays. The tests are in the [**tests**](../__tests__/) folder. The code is written in TypeScript. To compile the code, type:

```bash
npx tsc
```

To test the code, type:

```bash
npm run test
```

This will run all tests in the [**tests**](../__tests__/) folder.
